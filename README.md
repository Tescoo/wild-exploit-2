# wild-exploit-2
Exploit on RBLXWild, patched in under an hour. 100% profit.

# Exploit? What exploit?
2v2 group mode. Thats all I have to say.

I also have to say that its patched so fuck off messaging me.

# Alright, how did it work?
Well how the fuck do you think it worked, 2v2 group mode.

# Why is this an exploit? Surely that sounds normal.
Well your winnings got duplicated.

Battles are split in "teams" instead of "players"

Meaning that the full pot was duplicated for both teams, which makes no sense but whatever.

So basically you got profit every single time.

# Proof of concept

Steps for the exploit:

#### Step 1

Establish a connection with RBLXWild over websockets and authenticate yourself.

#### Step 2

Opt in to case battles, then send this string

`42["casebattles:create",{"caseInputs":[{"id":case id here,"quantity":amount of cases}],"versusType":"2v2","crazyMode":false,"groupMode":true,"fastAnimation":true,"funding":0}]`

Change `case id here` to a case id. You can find this by clicking on a case and looking at the frame emitted

Change `amount of cases` to, drumroll please........... amount of cases.

#### Step 3

Yeah thats it, lol.

I don't believe I originally found this, but all it took was 1 message to spread it like a wildfire.
